## My process

First structure html for navbar (it was complicated for me)... 
i use the bootstrap class to build the page with two cols and define the mobile size.
In the first col, i put the content inside (h1, description, learn-button, etc)
For the second col i put the img inside to the div (no backgroun)
i did the mobile size with media querys... i hid the img-desk in mobile size and i use visibility class for show the mobile img (its the answer for soluting problems)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BOOTSTRAP (Flexbox, GRID and RESPONSIVE)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practice makes a master... I tested my knowledge with html and css (states).

### Continued development

I'm making devs web with javascript...(memotest) for develop my programation logic and web design, in addition to practicing the front-end knowledge.
